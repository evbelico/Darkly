Open inspector and go to "Application" pannel, then decode the md5 "I_am_admin" cookie value :
- Decoded original value : 68934a3e9455fa72420237eb05902327 -> false

Now md5 encrypt "true" :
- Hashed value of "true" : b326b5062b2f0e69046810717534cb09

Enter the new value and refresh the page, a javascript alert will pop with the flag.

How to prevent : never store important data inside cookies (passwords, credit card numbers...). Use better encryption. Set a cookie expiration date (for example when the users logs out). In PHP you can completely avoid using cookies (handled by the client) while using sessions (handled by the server), to store data. If you use PHP's session only a session cookie will be generated.
