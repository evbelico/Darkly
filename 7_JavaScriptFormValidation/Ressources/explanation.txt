Look for the <form> tags and change the value of the js validate_form function from "this" to ""/NULL, then the flag should appear.
The form naturally won't let you submit empty fields, but with this method the input check gets bypassed.

You can also trigger the flag only by inputting <> tags in the name section then submiting the form.
