The footer section of the website contains icons which redirect to specific website (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram). The link structure is like this : index.php?page=redirect&site=twitter
The 'page' parameter indicates the name of the page, here it's 'redirect' so it knows it redirects to another website (here, Twitter).
The 'site' parameter can probably take any URL to redirect to, here it's 'twitter'.
Let's try to change the URL, like so : index.php?page=redirect&site=https://www.42.fr/ then click on the icon. The flag should appear.

How to prevent : Hardcode links in <a> tags instead of relying on another page to handle the redirection. Like so <a href="https://www.instagram.com/">. Anything else could lead to a fraudulous redirection, on a phishing site for example.
