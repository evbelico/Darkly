Simply type 'script' in the name and comment section, and the flag should appear (this is usually done with '<script>[code]</script>' tags, but here the website recognizes directly 'script');
This is a basic XSS (Cross Site Scripting) attack, which is basically injecting/running malicious code on the website (done using javascript here), which alterates the usual behaviour of the website (we could steal informations, crash the website, etc).

How to prevent it : sanitize all inputs on the website. In PHP it can be done with a homemade function or just the htmlspecialchars() functions, which detects '<>' characters. Do the same on the client-side.
For best security, reject user input which contains such characters (as adviced by the OWASP project), just to be sure;
